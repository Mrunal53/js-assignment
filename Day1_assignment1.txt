	For example:
		console.log("this will replace it")


Various methods are as follows:
console.log(),console.assert(),console.clear(),console.count(),console.countReset(),console.debug(),console.error(),console.warn(),console.time(),console.timeEnd(),etc.

	1. console.log()
	For general output of logging information. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method.

	2.console.assert()
	Log a message and stack trace to console if the first argument is false.

	3.console.clear()

	4.console.count()
	Log the number of times this line has been called with the given label.

	5.console.countReset()
	Resets the value of the counter with the given label.

	6.console.debug()
	Outputs a message to the console with the log level "debug".

QUESTION 2:
[2] write the difference between var, let and const wwith code examples.
Ans)
	1) var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let & const are block spaced.
	2) var variables can e updated and redeclared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not redeclared; 
	   const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
	3) They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized  with underdefned, let and const variables are not
           initialized.
		eg of var: var a = 10;
		code eg:
		function nodeSimplified() {
		  var a = 10;
		  console.log(a);
		  if (true) {
			var a=20;
		  	console.log(a);
		}
		console.log(a);
		}

		eg of let : let a = 10;
		code eg:
		function nodeSimplified() {
		  let a = 10;
		  console.log(a);
		  if (true) {
			let a=20;
			console.log(a);
		}
		console.log(a);
		}
		eg of const: const a = 10;
		code eg:
		function  nodeSimplified() {
		const MY_VARIABLE = 10;
		console.log(MY_VARIABLE);
		}


QUESTION 3:
[3] write a brief on available data types in js 
Ans)
There are 8 data types in js:
	1) Number : it represent both integers and floating point numbers  like *,/,+,- and so on.
		let n = 123;
		n = 12.345;
	2) BigInt: it is creating by appending n to the end of an integer.
		const bigInt = 12345678901234567891234567890123456789n
	3) String: It must be surrounded bu quotes.i.e; double quotes , single quotes, Backticks.
		let str = "Hello"
		let str = 'Hello'
		let str = `Hello`
	4) Boolean: it has two values True and False.
		let nameFieldChecked = true;
		let ageFieldChecked = false;
	5) null: it forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value.
		let age = null;
	6) undefined: it makes a type of its own , just like null. it means value is not assigned.
		let age;
		age = undefined;
		alert(age);
	7) objects and  symbols
	8) the typeof operator : 2types- typeof x 
					 typeof(x)
